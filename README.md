This script can be modified or copied into the build script in Jenkins

The buildscript.sh is forked from the original [here](http://www.itworksonmymachine.net/index.php/2015/02/12/jenkins-ci-xamarin-ios-xamarin-test-cloud-testflight-part-2/) which is also an adaption of [this one](https://nicolasgoles.com/blog/2011/08/continuous-integration-with-jenkins/).

It requires [Parameterized Trigger Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Parameterized+Trigger+Plugin) for Jenkins and needs `CONFIGURATION` and `DEVICE` parameters defined in it.
